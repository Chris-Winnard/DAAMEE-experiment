Several of the scripts (for the Questionnaire, Part 1-3, and the main calibration script) were created using PsychoPy:

The Perception and Emotion sections of the questionnaire were taken directly from the Goldsmith’s Musical Sophistication Index:
D. Müllensiefen, B. Gingras, J. Musil, and L. Stewart, “The musicality of non-musicians: An index for assessing musical sophistication in the general population,” *PLoS One*, vol. 9, no. 2, Article no. e89642, 2014. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0089642](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089642).

Also, thanks to Nhan Duc Thanh Nguyen for all of his help setting up the PsychoPy scripts for the Questionnaire and Parts 1-3 of the experiment.
