Part 2:
-Similar process as in part 1 for stimuli (for each set of three streams there will be three copies, but in each case there will be an oddball and arrow pointing left/right/centre).
-Must display arrow.
-Will have to set the system up to give feedback.

Part 3:
-Exact same process as in part 1 for stimuli.
-For the attend/do not attend condition, will need a separate random number generator.
