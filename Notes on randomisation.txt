Part 2:
-Similar process as in part 1 for stimuli (for each set of three streams there will be three copies, but in each case there will be an oddball and arrow pointing left/right/centre).
-Must display arrow.
-Will have to set the system up to give feedback.
   -For this, I think have set up a "correctAnswer" boolean. Iff the input to textbox = the number of oddballs, then correctAnswer = True.
   -I'm not entirely sure how to set up the oddballs. Perhaps it will need to be done manually, a number of times for each stream combination and each attended instrument (I could use
   random number generators to decide when to have them/how many to have).

Part 3:
-Exact same process as in part 1 for stimuli.
-For the attend/do not attend condition, will need a separate random number generator.
